# Breakout Game

## Description
Breakout is a classic arcade game where players control a paddle to bounce a ball against a wall of bricks. The objective is to destroy all the bricks by hitting them with the ball while preventing the ball from falling off the bottom edge of the screen.

## Game Mechanics

- **Levels**: The game becomes progressively more challenging as players advance through levels.
